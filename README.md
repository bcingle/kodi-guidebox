A Kodi video addon for the Guidebox API

Guidebox is a web service that provides links to streaming media sources.  It provides a navigable API and search capabilities to find your favorite shows. This addon provides a comprehensive front-end to the Guidebox API, allowing one to navigate through TV Shows and Movies, and access various streaming links.

This addon uses a free API key from Guidebox.  They place some limits on usage, such as the number of API calls per second and per month.  If the limit is reached, then I will either delete the shared key and require users to acquire their own key, or move to a paid key and ask for donations.  But for now the free key is sufficient.

This addon uses fanart from TheMovieDB.  Please visit them at https://www.themoviedb.org/ and contribute to their fantastic movie and TV show database.
